	    <P>We made a lot of changes to WF-Downloads. There are a lot of obselete files now that will no longer be used. <br /><B>If you feel comfortable with this </B>you could delete most of the old files in the <I>'modules/wfdownloads'</I> directory - <B>if not skip to the next step.</B><br />
		If you want to do this:<ul>
		<LI>you are advised to backup your files first ... just in case</LI>

   		    - the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">'uploads'</FONT> subfolder and its contents if there are more files in it then just index.php<br />
			- any file or folder you might have created yourself that came not from the original WF-Downloads installation</UL><br />
         Please note that we are only talking about deleting files. DO NOT uninstall WF-Downloads.<br /><B>If you feel uncomfortable with this than don´t do it. It will create no problems to skip this step - just some unused files will remain on your server.  ;)</B></li><p>
